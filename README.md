# csl622_project

The csl622 project "User characterization" updates are here.

Uptil now test2.py takes input an xml file and output the names of all contibutors into a demofile.txt text file.
The test2.py part will be changed to output ip addresses of anonymous contributors too.

The test.py file takes input all names from demofile.txt and creates an url string that outputs an html file of all contributions made by that contributor till now.
The test.py will be changed to read the html files and store the edits and topics edited simultaneously so that instead of creating different files for different users, a single file can do all that work.
